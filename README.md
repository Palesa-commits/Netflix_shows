**Project Description: Entertainment Database Management System**

This project involves the creation of a database management system for entertainment content, including TV shows, movies, and other media available on the streaming platform Netflix. 

The database consists of several tables:
- **tvshows**: Stores information about various TV shows, including their titles, episode duration, genres, start and end dates, ratings, and types.
- **movies**: Stores details about movies, such as titles, durations, genres, ratings, and types.
- **netflix_tvshows**: Records TV shows available on Netflix, linking them to the main TV shows table.
- **netflix_movies**: Stores movies available on Netflix, with references to the main movies table.
- **netflix_others**: Contains additional media available on Netflix, such as specials or exclusive content.
  
The project includes functionalities such as:
- Inserting data into the database tables.
- Updating records to indicate availability on Netflix.
- Creating views to display TV shows and movies with Netflix availability.
- Implementing stored procedures and functions for specific tasks, such as identifying action movies available on Netflix and determining if TV shows are eligible for renewal.
- Exploring the database using SQL queries, including grouping and filtering operations.

Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive database management system for organizing and managing entertainment content, particularly focusing on content available on the Netflix streaming platform.
